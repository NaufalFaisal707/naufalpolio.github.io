# Building a Simple Blog with Tailwind Typography

Creating beautiful articles with rich typography doesn't have to be hard. Let's build a simple blog using Tailwind CSS and its typography plugin.

## Setup

First install the required dependencies:

```bash
npm install -D @tailwindcss/typography
```

Then add the typography plugin to your `tailwind.config.js`:

```js
module.exports = {
  theme: {
    // ...
  },
  plugins: [
    require('@tailwindcss/typography'),
  ],
}
```

## Usage

Simply wrap your markdown content in a div with the `prose` class:

```html
<article class="prose lg:prose-xl">
  <!-- Your markdown content here -->
</article>
```

Now your content will be beautifully styled with proper typography including:

- Balanced headings
- Proper spacing
- Optimized line lengths
- Nice link styles
- Beautiful lists and blockquotes

The typography plugin handles all the styling details so you can focus on writing great content.
